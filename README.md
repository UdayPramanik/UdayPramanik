<h2> About Me: </h2>

- New to GitHub
- I am a student with my major in Physics and I'm currently doing my post-graduation.
- Having Physics as my major has only encouraged me to take up Computer Programming and someday I am going to master it.
- I currently know Computational Programming (Python, SciLab and MatLab) and running real-world simulations using AI/ML.
- I have my interests in Blockchain and DeSci space. I also hope to get my hands on [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) very soon.
- Currently I am learning Solidity from the wonderful [PatrickAlphaC](https://www.github.com/PatrickAlphaC) through his course:
  -   [YouTube](https://youtu.be/gyMwXuJrbJQ)
  -   [GitHub](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js)
- I also like listening to Alternate and Psychdelic Rock music, travelling, photography, reading and pushing myself to the limits.
- Up for any open source contribution on my level.   
- Hit me up through my email : uday221100@gmail.com and my twitter (link above).
